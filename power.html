	<h1>Lone's Powers</h1>
	<p>The power that Lone has is one where he could go invisable and is good at being able to read other peoples body language and tell what their modd is. 
	Lone doesn't use his invisability skill just anytime or for bad. He mainly uses it at the times he just doesn't want to be seen by the poeple in the city 
	the times he goes. Or the times he feels most vulnerable a way for him to hide. </p>
